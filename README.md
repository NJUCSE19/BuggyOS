# FPGA Final Lab

This is the repository for the final FPGA lab.

## Brief introduction

### Maintainers

Maxwell (Yunzhe Lv) and doowzs (Tianyun Zhang).

### Deadline

December 24th (Monday), 2018.

## Project Target

### CPU

- Support 32-bit instructions and data, implement 4-8 registers.
- Can run basic RAM read/write operations, ALU, comparison and Jcc instructions.

### RAM

- RAM with trivial data and instructions.
- Size no less than 1 KByte.

### I/O

- Input from keyborad and output using VGA.
- 7-segment display is also acceptable.
- Codes can be translated into assembly and written into RAM.

### Basic Functions

- Can read instructions from keyboard and execute, including basic arithmetics, loops and branchs.
- E.g. Calculate the n-th number of the Fibonacci sequence.

### Extended Functions

- More instructions, bootloader, step-in debugger, etc. (May not attempt)

## Detailed Guidelines

### CPU Instruction Set

The CPU will use 32-bit MIPS instruction set.
